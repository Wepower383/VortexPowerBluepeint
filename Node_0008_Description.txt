Node 0008: Vortex Power Blueprint
This system harvests energy using vortex dynamics. It uses a spiral flow chamber, a Venturi nozzle to accelerate flow, magnets, and copper coils to generate electricity.

Key Components:
- Spiral Vortex Chamber
- Venturi Funnel
- Copper-Magnet Turbine
- Optional Resonance Core (quartz, mycelium)

Designed for wind, water, or plasma input. Can be hybridized with Node 0005 (Symbiogen Coil).
